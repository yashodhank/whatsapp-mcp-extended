// resolvePollVoteContent decrypts an incoming poll-vote event and renders it as readable
// message content, e.g. "[Poll Vote: Expected — dev/test, no action needed]".
//
// WhatsApp's poll protocol never transmits option text for a vote, only SHA-256 hashes of the
// selected option(s) (see whatsmeow's DecryptPollVote docs) — so this has two jobs, not one:
// decrypt the vote via the poll's message secret (which whatsmeow's SDK already persisted
// automatically when the poll was sent, nothing extra needed there), then match each selected
// hash against the original poll's option list, which this bridge must have stored itself (see
// HandleMessage's PollCreationMessage branch and CreatePoll). If either step can't complete —
// the secret isn't in the local store, or the original poll's options were never captured — this
// returns a descriptive placeholder instead of silently dropping the vote, which is what
// happened before this existed: no content, no media, message discarded with no trace anywhere.
